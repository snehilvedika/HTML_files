    <h3>Introducing paragraph tag</h3>
    <p>The p HTML element represents a paragraph.
     Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media 
     as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks 
     by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, 
     but HTML paragraphs can be any structural 
     grouping of related content, such as images or form fields </p>
